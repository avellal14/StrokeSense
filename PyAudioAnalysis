Link to the library GitHub: https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis.git

A link was used because the library was too large to compress and upload.

Noted Changes:
- In audioFeatureExtraction.py, we changed the mt_win and mt_step parameters in the mtFeatureExtractionToFile methods from constants to be proportional to file length for the improved scanning of the audio files.
